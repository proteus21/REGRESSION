For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. 
Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10.
For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7).
The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables such as:

Fixed acidity, Volatile acidity, Citric acid, Residual sugar, Chlorides

Free sulfur dioxide, Total sulfur dioxide, Density, pH, Sulfates, Alcohol
